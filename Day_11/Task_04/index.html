            especially recognized as a Bidrohi Kobi (rebel poet) around the
            country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of
            Bangladesh. The famous poet Nazrul's writings deal with the
            revolution of that period of the British government. His

            Bangladesh. He has raised his voice against any kinds of fascism and
            oppression and got popularity swiftly around the Indian
            Subcontinent.</p>
