        HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web. 
It enables the exchange of information between a web server and a client, typically a web browser. 
Over the years, HTTP has evolved to enhance performance, security, and efficiency. Two significant versions of the protocol,
HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2, have played a pivotal role in shaping the modern web.


Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are:

HTTP/1.1  :

* It works on the textual format.	
* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.	
* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	
* It compresses data by itself.	

HTTP/2  : 

* It works on the binary protocol.
* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
* It uses HPACK for data compression.
